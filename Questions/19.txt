Write a JavaScript program that simulates a food delivery process using asynchronous functions. The 
program should: 
1. Simulate placing an order with a delay of 1 second. 
2. Simulate preparing food with a delay of 3 seconds. 
3. Simulate packaging the food and delivering it concurrently, where packaging takes 1 second and 
delivery takes 2 seconds. 
4. Log messages at each step to indicate the progress of the food delivery process.
